I change some things in my earlier thinking in the project.
I need you to update that homework and make wayyy better and morreee detailed.
Read the code, understand how the project works. and re-do the assignment. but structure should be same/similar better. more detailed and everything. also tell me what you think or give me recommendations.

 I'll upload here the old homework, and new code.
I'll write the new use cases below:
So I need you the do/update/create/add these.
if I'm not mistaken in the old assignment only difference is chatwith bot. and that will be simple as this, it  is already in the code if you check. It will detect the message and say either "recognized the code, taking action" something like that, or didn't understand you. 
and the rest is pretty straight forward to understand.
