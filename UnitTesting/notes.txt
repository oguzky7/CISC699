what I want:
"Thank you for providing a clear and detailed explanation of how you'd like your test case documentation structured. I understand that you're looking for thorough, methodical documentation that includes:

Description of the test case, detailing what the test is supposed to achieve.
Steps of the test case, explaining each phase in detail, including setup, execution, and validation points.
Test Data used during the tests, specifying both valid and invalid input scenarios.
Test Scenarios, Expected Outcomes, and Actual Outcomes, documenting the start and end of each test, as well as logging expected vs. actual results for transparency and traceability.
Source Code reference, providing links to where the code can be reviewed for further detail.
From now on, when you share a use case name, code, and output, I will prepare the documentation to match this structure. This includes providing detailed descriptions, explicitly stated test steps with their purpose, and clear indications of expected and actual outcomes. Additionally, I'll format the documentation to ensure it's professional and easy to navigate, maintaining consistency with the example you've provided."

Please keep the structure as I shared above for test case1

paste the output the way it is. just normal plain text the way it is.

Make the documentation for the following use cases
